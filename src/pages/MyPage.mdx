# Scrolli Components

Welcome to the Scrolli Components documentation. This library provides a collection of reusable components for building clean, modern, and accessible user interfaces, designed for digital publishing and storytelling platforms like Scrolli.co.

Scrolli.co is a digital platform offering insightful analysis and stories on technology, culture, and societal trends. Designed for curious general audiences, it prioritizes concise, well-researched journalism over clickbait, blending depth with accessibility. The site's clean, minimalist layout emphasizes readability, using bold headlines, high-quality visuals, and intuitive navigation to create a seamless experience across devices.
