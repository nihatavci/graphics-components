# Writing docs-only pages

You can write docs-only pages in simple markdown using MDX format.

> MDX is _technically_ a mixture of markdown and React. Unforuntately, there isn't a native Svelte option for markdown pages in Storybook yet. Good news, though, you won't _really_ need to know React to use it. Just write in markdown and follow the template below for the React bits you'll need.

### Quickstart

Make a new `.stories.mdx` file for your docs page in the `src/docs/` directory.

```
src/
  docs/
    my-docs.stories.mdx
```

Add the following at the top of the file and customise the `title` property in the `Meta` component for where you want the page to live in the Storybook nav.

```markdown
import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs';
import { parameters } from '$docs/utils/docsPage.js';

<Meta title="SCSS/Special rules" parameters={{ ...parameters }} />

# My docs page

Your docs TK...
```

From there, write whatever you need in markdown.
